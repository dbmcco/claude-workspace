# Project Manager Standardization - Complete Implementation

ABOUTME: Complete deliverable summary for PM standardization based on taskmgr success pattern
ABOUTME: Templates, tools, and strategy for systematic project management across complex projects

## Executive Summary

Successfully extracted the proven Project Manager pattern from `/Users/braydon/projects/personal/taskmgr/` and created a standardized, deployable system for complex projects requiring systematic coordination.

### 4. Updated Consistency Plan

Enhanced `/Users/braydon/projects/claude-workspace/claude_consistency_plan.md` with:

#### PM Standardization Strategy
- **Eligible Projects**: Complex development projects requiring coordination
  - `/Users/braydon/projects/personal/home_meal_planner`
  - `/Users/braydon/projects/personal/moneycommand`
  - `/Users/braydon/projects/work/lfw/lfw-draftforge`
  - `/Users/braydon/projects/work/lfw/lfw-forgeworks`
  - `/Users/braydon/projects/work/resilience/resilience_py`

#### Deployment Approach
- **Additive Implementation**: Add PM structure alongside existing configurations
- **Preservation Strategy**: Backup existing CLAUDE.md files
- **Gradual Adoption**: Deploy to 1-2 projects first, validate, then expand
- **Choice Architecture**: Projects can choose PM mode vs direct development mode

#### Integration with Existing Plan
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (existing settings/MCP standardization)
- **Phase 2**: PM Standardization (new addition)
- **Phase 3**: Maintenance and Evolution

## Success Pattern Analysis

### From taskmgr Reference Implementation

#### What Works (Preserved in Templates)
1. **PM-Only Role**: Never codes directly, always delegates to sub-agents
2. **Task Interview System**: Systematic clarification of vague requirements
3. **Sub-Agent Specialization**: Clear delegation patterns for different work types
4. **Context Preservation**: Strategic overview maintained for Braydon interactions
5. **Real-Time Tracking**: Continuous updates to task and project status
6. **Quality Gate Integration**: Non-negotiable quality standards enforced

#### Key Behaviors Standardized
- Task clarification using structured interview questions
- Sub-agent delegation via Task tool with specific agent roles
- Progress tracking in tasks.md and project_status.md
- Quality gate enforcement before task completion
- Strategic context preservation for stakeholder communication

## Implementation Strategy

### Deployment Sequence
1. **Pilot Deployment**: Deploy to 1-2 complex projects first
2. **Validation**: Use validation tools to verify correct deployment
3. **Refinement**: Adjust templates based on real-world usage

## Integration with Existing Ecosystem

### Compatibility
- **Settings Standardization**: PM structure works with existing settings configurations
- **MCP Integration**: Compatible with standard MCP configurations
- **Memory System**: Integrates with existing claude-workspace memory architecture
- **Quality Gates**: Builds on existing TDD and quality enforcement

### Non-Breaking Design
- **Additive Only**: No changes to existing working configurations
- **Backup Strategy**: Original files preserved as legacy backups
- **Optional Adoption**: Projects can choose PM mode or keep current approach
- **Gradual Migration**: Phased deployment reduces risk

This comprehensive PM standardization provides a systematic approach for complex projects while maintaining the successful direct development approach for simpler projects. The standardization preserves what works from the taskmgr reference implementation while making it reusable across the project ecosystem.
