# Retirement Integration Feature

## Feature Overview
This file provides guidance to Claude when working with the Retirement Integration feature. This feature connects Tiller financial data with retirement planning models in `/apps/fin_analysis`, enabling data-driven retirement projections.

## Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Follow strict TDD approach: tests first, then implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. Write failing tests (RED)
  2. Implement minimal code to pass tests (GREEN)
  3. Refactor for quality and maintainability (REFACTOR)
- Test coverage target: 90%

### Code Quality Standards
- Type annotations for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Modular design with single responsibility
- Error handling and validation
- Performance considerations for large datasets

### Dependencies
- lib/data_access: Use for all data access operations
- lib/analysis_engines: Use for analytical functions
- lib/report_generation: Use for report creation
- Multi-Entity Tracking: For entity-specific financial data

## Implementation Context

### Current Implementation
The current implementation is partial, with initial analysis in `analysis/retirement_integration_summary.md`. Key aspects:
- Data flow design between Tiller and retirement model
- Initial data mapping strategy
- Implementation phases outlined
- Technical requirements identified

### Migration Path
1. Create comprehensive data extraction module
2. Implement financial metrics calculation
3. Build connector to retirement model
4. Develop scenario analysis capabilities
5. Create unified dashboard

## Role-Specific Instructions

### For Test Developer
- Create comprehensive test cases for data extraction
- Test financial metric calculations with known values
- Create mock retirement model for testing
- Test different scenario configurations
- Ensure integration tests cover the full workflow

### For Developer
- Implement code to meet test requirements
- Ensure efficient data extraction from Tiller
- Develop robust connector to retirement model
- Implement Monte Carlo simulation capabilities
- Create dashboard generation logic

### For Architect
- Design clean interfaces between components
- Ensure proper integration with both Tiller and retirement model
- Plan for extensible scenario analysis framework
- Design secure data management approach

### For QA
- Verify data extraction accuracy
- Test financial metric calculations
- Validate retirement model updates
- Verify Monte Carlo simulation results
- Test dashboard generation
- Validate security measures

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure
- `data_extractor.py`: Tiller data extraction
- `metrics_calculator.py`: Financial metrics calculation
- `retirement_connector.py`: Integration with retirement model
- `scenario_analyzer.py`: Scenario and sensitivity analysis
- `monte_carlo_simulator.py`: Monte Carlo simulation
- `dashboard_generator.py`: Unified dashboard creation

### Key Functions Required
- `extract_tiller_data(tiller_file) -> financial_data`
- `calculate_financial_metrics(financial_data) -> metrics`
- `map_to_retirement_model(metrics) -> model_inputs`
- `update_retirement_model(model_inputs) -> model_outputs`
- `analyze_retirement_scenarios(financial_data, model) -> scenarios`
- `run_monte_carlo_simulation(model, iterations) -> simulation_results`
- `generate_unified_dashboard(financial_data, retirement_data) -> dashboard`

### Data Structures
- FinancialData: Dict with income, expenses, assets, transactions
- FinancialMetrics: Dict with savings_rate, returns, milestones
- RetirementInputs: Dict with model-specific input parameters
- RetirementOutputs: Dict with projections, success_rates, milestones
- RetirementScenario: Dict with parameters, results, comparison
- SimulationResults: Dict with distributions, probabilities, visualizations
- Dashboard: Dict with current_finances, projections, recommendations
