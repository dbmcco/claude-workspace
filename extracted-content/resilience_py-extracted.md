# Financial Modeling Framework - Development Guidelines

Python-based financial modeling framework for film/TV production companies with parent-subsidiary structures.

## CRITICAL: Development Standards

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY
- YOU MUST write failing tests BEFORE any implementation
- Tests MUST define the desired functionality completely
- Implementation MUST be minimal to pass tests
- Refactoring MUST maintain green tests
- NO EXCEPTIONS to TDD process

### 2. Linting is REQUIRED for ALL Code
- ALL code MUST pass linting before commits
- Linting configs MUST be created during project setup
- Language-specific linters MUST be configured
- Code formatting MUST be automated where possible
- Linting errors MUST be fixed, not ignored

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks are ENFORCED
- Pre-commit hooks MUST be installed during setup
- Hooks MUST verify linting passes
- Hooks MUST run relevant tests
- Hooks MUST check for secrets/credentials
- Hooks MUST validate commit message format
- NO commits should bypass hooks

### 4. Git Integration from Start
- Git MUST be initialized immediately
- Feature branches MUST be used for all work
- Commits MUST be frequent and atomic
- Commit messages MUST follow conventional format
- Main branch MUST be protected

## Project Overview

**Purpose:** Build a comprehensive financial modeling framework for production companies that demonstrates financial stewardship to investors

**Status:** In Progress - Production Template Development Phase

**Type:** Financial Modeling Software - Python Framework

## Current Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-23

**Project Update:** New PRD and Requirements documents added. Need to implement missing components for complete financial modeling platform.

**What's Implemented:**

- Feature branch workflow
- PR reviews required
- CI/CD integration
- Protected main branch

## Issues and Decisions

**Decisions Made:**
- Language: Python 3.9+
- Testing: pytest for TDD
- Linting: flake8 + black
- CLI: Click framework
- Data: pandas for financial modeling
- Parameter types: 8 supported types with validation
- Entity relationships: parent-child hierarchy model

**Open Issues:**
- Specific investor documentation templates needed
- Impact measurement framework selection
- Risk analysis methodology choices
- Deployment and distribution strategy

## Agent Coordination

All agents coordinate through a single master document:
- **`COORDINATION.md`** - Single source of truth for all tasks, status, decisions, and communication
- Update this file regularly throughout the day
- Check it first thing when starting work
- All decisions, blockers, and progress tracked here

### Standard Agent Prompt Format
**IMPORTANT**: Use the comprehensive template in `AGENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` for all agent assignments.

The template includes:
1. **Role Identification**: Clearly state which agent role is being addressed
2. **Current Task**: Specific task to be completed
3. **Project Location**: Full path to project directory
4. **Context**: Background information, prerequisites, file locations
5. **Development Standards**: TDD, linting, pre-commit hooks (MANDATORY)
6. **Git Workflow**: Branch creation, commit standards, hook compliance
7. **File Locations**: Exact paths for all created files
8. **Key Functionality**: Detailed list of features to implement
9. **Testing Requirements**: Coverage standards and test types
10. **Documentation Standards**: What to update, where, and how
11. **Communication Protocol**: How to report completion and handoffs
12. **Success Criteria**: Measurable completion requirements
13. **Quality Checklist**: Verification steps before completion
14. **Next Steps**: What happens after task completion

All prompts must include:
- Explicit file paths
- Exact commands to run
- Specific documentation locations
- Clear handoff instructions
- Git workflow requirements
- Testing and quality standards

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this template to new project directory
2. Run `./scripts/init_project.sh`
3. Follow interactive setup prompts
4. Verify all quality tools are configured
5. Begin development with TDD

Remember: Quality is not negotiable. TDD, linting, and pre-commit hooks are fundamental to our development process.
