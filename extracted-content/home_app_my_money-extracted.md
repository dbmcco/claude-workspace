# Integrated Development Pipeline Project Memory

## Project Focus
The Integrated Claude Development Pipeline aims to create a hybrid software development workflow that combines:
1. Interactive Claude sessions for creative, exploratory phases (requirements, planning)
2. Deterministic, headless Claude processing for structured implementation phases (TDD, coding, testing)

## Key Insights
Our revised understanding emphasizes:
- Early phases benefit from interactive dialog (PM/BA roles)
- Later phases need deterministic, repeatable processing (Developer/Tester roles)
- Output from each phase must feed structured input to the next
- The entire process should be orchestrated by scripts with clear handoffs

## Implementation Status
We've built the initial infrastructure:
1. Project initialization script (/apps/init_project.sh)
2. Project interview workflow (/apps/project_interview.sh)
3. Basic directory structure creation
4. Placeholder role scripts

## Critical Gaps
1. Role scripts are currently designed for interactive-only mode
2. Missing pipeline coordination between stages
3. Need structured output capture from interactive sessions
4. Headless processing scripts for test/code/test workflow not implemented
5. Artifact management between stages not addressed

## Next Steps
1. Revise role scripts to use the hybrid interactive/headless model
2. Implement export functions to capture outputs from interactive sessions
3. Create headless processing scripts for generating TDD tests from requirements
4. Build pipeline coordination for the testâ†’codeâ†’test workflow
5. Add structured output parsers for each stage

## Technical Approach
- Interactive sessions should have export/capture mechanisms
- Headless sessions should follow strict input/output patterns
- Each script should validate its input and output
- Memory management should support both modes
- MCP server should provide deterministic tooling

## Key Workflow
1. PM/BA: Interactive sessions â†’ Structured requirements
2. Architect: Semi-interactive review â†’ Architecture spec
3. TDD: Headless processing â†’ Test files
4. Developer: Headless implementation â†’ Code files
5. Tester: Headless validation â†’ Test results
6. Refinement: Mix of interactive review and headless fixes

## Next Steps (When Session Resumes)

**See `/dev_team/status/PROJECT_MANAGER_EOD_MAY16_2025.md` for complete handoff**

1. Review end-of-day summary and check regression testing progress
2. Execute QA Engineer prompt for PostgreSQL testing (included in EOD doc)
3. Test Transaction Detail feature with real PostgreSQL data
4. Verify API performance with 4,349 transactions
5. Make Go/No-Go decision for May 23 release based on test results
6. Update PR template with real-data requirements if proceeding

## Real-Data Testing Approach

All testing must use real financial data patterns rather than synthetic data:

1. **Realistic Data Sources**:
   - Tiller Excel import (4,349 transactions now in PostgreSQL)
   - Real-world financial patterns (dates, amounts, descriptions)

2. **Entity Boundaries**:
   - Test with real entity relationships
   - Explicit security boundary testing
   - Multi-entity architecture testing

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Large transactions (> $10,000)
   - Negative amounts (expenses)
   - Split transactions with proper reconciliation
   - Zero-amount transfers
   - Multiple currency formats

4. **Test Data Utilities**:
   - Real transaction patterns for fixtures
   - Sanitized but structurally accurate data
   - Entity relationship preservation

## Build/Test Commands
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Tests: `npm test` 
- Running a single test: `npm test -- tests/path/to/test.js`
- Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Import Tiller data: `npm run import:tiller`

## Git Workflow

All development must follow our Git workflow:
- Create feature branches from `develop`
- Follow branch naming: `feature/feature-name`
- Use Conventional Commits format for commit messages
- Create PRs for merging to `develop`
- Require reviews before merging
- Delete branches after merging

Refer to `/dev_team/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Linter Instructions

Claude Code CLI should enforce our linting standards by:

1. Running ESLint with our configuration before making changes
2. Ensuring all code changes comply with our ESLint and Prettier rules
3. Following TypeScript strict mode guidelines
4. Maintaining proper import ordering (external libraries first, then internal)
5. Using consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types/interfaces/components)
6. Following project-specific patterns established in existing code
7. Detecting and preventing mock data patterns

When linting errors are detected, Claude should:
1. Flag the issues and suggest fixes
2. Follow fix patterns consistently across all files
3. Explain the reasoning behind linting rules when relevant

Refer to `/dev_team/LINTER_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration.

## Test-Driven Development

All development must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:
1. Write tests first using real data patterns
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing

Maintain minimum test coverage thresholds:
- UI Components: 80%
- Services: 90%
- Utilities: 95%
- API Endpoints: 85%
- Overall: 80%

Refer to `/dev_team/TDD_GUIDELINES.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Todo Tool Usage

Claude should use the Todo tool to:
- Track development tasks
- Update task status as work progresses
- Break complex features into specific tasks
- Add estimated effort levels to tasks
- Mark tasks as `in_progress` when starting work
- Mark tasks as `completed` when finishing work

## WebSearch Tool Usage

Claude should use WebSearch to:
- Research best practices before implementation
- Find documentation for libraries
- Look up solutions to technical challenges
- Validate architectural decisions against industry standards

## Batch Tool Usage

Claude should use Batch for:
- Finding patterns across multiple files
- Running multiple search operations concurrently
- Analyzing code from multiple perspectives

## Task Tool Usage

Claude should use Task for:
- Complex analysis of codebase patterns
- Generating test strategies
- Planning refactoring operations
- Security analysis

## Sequence-Based Work Approach

Follow our sequence-based collaboration model for all development work:
1. Work should proceed according to defined sequence documents
2. Task dependencies must be respected
3. Quality gates must be passed before proceeding to next phase
4. Documentation must be updated alongside code

Refer to `/dev_team/COLLABORATION_MODEL.md` for detailed guidelines.

## Current Work Context - Regression Testing Phase

The current work focus is PostgreSQL regression testing before May 23 release:

1. **Database Migration**: âœ… PostgreSQL migration complete (May 16)
2. **Data Import**: âœ… 4,349 Tiller transactions imported (May 16)
3. **Next Priority**: Regression testing with PostgreSQL (May 17)
4. **Release Decision**: Go/No-Go pending test results
5. **Target Release**: May 23, 2025

- `/dev_team/testing/TRANSACTION_DETAIL_RELEASE_RECOMMENDATION.md` - Previous test results
- `/dev_team/sequences/TRANSACTION_DETAIL_RELEASE_SEQUENCE.md` - Release plan

## Code Style Guidelines
- TypeScript with strict type checking, interfaces for data structures
- JavaScript with ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks in React
- Follow file structure organization by feature
- Imports: Group by external libraries first, then internal modules
- Use descriptive variable/function naming with camelCase
- Error handling: Try/catch blocks with specific error types
- Prefer async/await over promise chains
- Use absolute paths for imports when available
- Use real data patterns for all tests

## Testing
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Always use real data for testing
- Write tests for all new functionality
