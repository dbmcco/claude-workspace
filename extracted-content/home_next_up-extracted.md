# Next Up - Job Search & Professional Networking Project Memory

This file serves as Claude's project memory. It provides essential context about the project, current status, and guidance for development.

## IMPORTANT - REAL DATA REQUIREMENT

THE USER REQUIRES WORKING WITH REAL DATA ONLY. DO NOT:
- Create sample/mock/synthetic data
- Generate placeholder content
- Use demo mode
- Build testing frameworks with fake information
- Suggest using dummy data for development
- Propose hypothetical test cases
- Use artificial examples for testing
- Fall back to synthetic data when real data is challenging
- Create abstract demonstrations without real data
- Develop with fictional use cases

This requirement applies to ALL development, testing, and demonstration activities. No exceptions. Every test must use actual data from the resources directory with real contacts, companies, and interactions. When asked to test or validate, always use real data from the existing sources and never create synthetic examples.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Obsidian-First Approach
We are implementing an Obsidian-first integration that allows users to manage their professional contacts directly through their Obsidian vault. This approach provides several advantages:

1. **Familiar Interface**: Users can work with familiar markdown text
2. **Local Data Control**: All information stays within the user's Obsidian vault
3. **Integrated Workflows**: Seamless connection with other knowledge management
4. **Enhanced Context**: Rich, linked context for each contact

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
To ensure high-quality implementation, we're adopting a strict TDD approach:

1. **Write Tests First**: All functionality begins with test cases
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests cover all edge cases and scenarios
3. **Automated Validation**: Continuous testing through automated processes
4. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Tests document expected behavior

### Anti-Fabrication Strategy
The system implements comprehensive measures to prevent data fabrication:

1. **Tiered Confidence Visualization**:
   - Very High (0.90-1.00): Normal text with no special indicators
   - High (0.70-0.89): Subtle indicator (â€ ) next to the entity
   - Medium (0.40-0.69): Clear indicator (â€¡) next to the entity
   - Low (0.20-0.39): Warning symbol (âš ) next to the entity
   - Very Low (0.00-0.19): Hidden by default, shown with special format if revealed

2. **Evidence-Based Calculation**:
   - All confidence scores are calculated from objective factors
   - Source quality, data recency, and corroboration factors
   - No confidence assigned without supporting evidence
   - Complete audit trail for all scores

## Current Challenges

### Data Normalization Issues
- Inconsistent field handling across different data sources (LinkedIn, LDA, etc.)
- Name field parsing issues causing "Unknown" last names for some contacts
- Need for more robust normalization requirements from BA
- Inappropriate data creation (e.g., copying first name to last name field)

### Testing Requirements
- Need for stricter TDD approach with tests before implementation
- Opportunity to improve code quality with comprehensive linting
- Requirement for more thorough validation of data transformation
- Need for comprehensive edge case handling
