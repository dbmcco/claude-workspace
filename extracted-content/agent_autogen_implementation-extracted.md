# AutoGen Implementation Project Memory

**Document ID: DOC-EIP-003**

## Project Focus
The AutoGen Implementation project focuses on creating an enhanced Integrated Development Pipeline using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. The pipeline combines:

1. Interactive sessions for creative, exploratory phases (requirements, planning)
2. Deterministic, headless processing for structured implementation phases (TDD, coding, testing)

## Current Status
As of May 16, 2025, we have:

1. Created a basic TDD pipeline that works with AutoGen agents through multiple phases
2. Enhanced the pipeline to read requirements from markdown files
3. Implemented a more comprehensive directory structure
4. Added CLI argument support for API keys and model selection
5. Created a new Integrated Development Pipeline with both interactive and headless phases
6. Tested the pipeline with a "Family Meal Planning App" example
7. Prepared a detailed enhancement plan to improve the UX and integration with real tools
8. Established traceability standards for requirements, code, tests, and documentation
9. Created detailed specifications for InteractiveRequirementsSession and RequirementsManager components
10. **CRITICAL ISSUE**: InteractiveRequirementsSession lacks actual user interaction capability despite being marked complete
11. Created comprehensive diagnostic report (DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_IRS.md) analyzing the implementation gap
12. Completed implementation of RequirementsManager, TraceabilityMatrix, FeatureSetManager, and EnhancedIntegratedPipeline

## Key Components

### Current Implementation

1. **phased_tdd_implementation.py**: Basic implementation of the TDD pipeline with sequential phases
2. **phased_tdd_implementation_md.py**: Enhanced version with markdown file support
3. **integrated_development_pipeline.py**: New implementation with both interactive and headless phases

### Completed Components

1. **RequirementsManager**: Support for post-phase requirement updates (COMPLETED)
2. **TraceabilityMatrix**: Tracking relationships between requirements and artifacts (COMPLETED)
3. **FeatureSetManager**: Management of multiple feature sets for complex applications (COMPLETED)
4. **EnhancedIntegratedPipeline**: Orchestration layer combining all components (COMPLETED)

### Components with Critical Gaps

1. **InteractiveRequirementsSession**: 
   - Status: Implementation exists but LACKS actual user interaction
   - Issue: Simulates dialog capability but provides no real user interaction
   - Required: 5-day effort to implement proper user I/O layer
   - Documentation: See DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT_IRS.md

### Pending Components

1. **CLIWithInteractiveShell**: Command-line interface with interactive shell support
2. **RealGitIntegration**: Actual Git operations for repository management
3. **RealCodeQuality**: Integration with real linting and code quality tools

## Critical Gaps and UX Issues

1. **Requirements Dialog (CRITICAL)**: InteractiveRequirementsSession has no actual user interaction - only simulates it
2. **Real Tool Integration**: Current pipeline uses simulated operations rather than real tools
3. **Interactive Shell**: CLI needs proper interactive capabilities to support user dialogs
4. **Quality Gates**: Needs integration with real code quality tools rather than simulations

## Enhancement Plan

We've created a detailed enhancement plan in `docs/ENHANCED_PIPELINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` that addresses these gaps. The implementation sequence is:

1. Core Requirements Management Framework
2. Real Tool Integration
3. Pipeline Integration
4. Refinement and Testing

## Usage Instructions

To run the current integrated pipeline:

```bash
python tdd_pipeline/integrated_development_pipeline.py --api-key=your_openai_api_key
```

Additional options:
- `--model`: Model to use (default: gpt-4o)
- `--model-provider`: Provider (openai or anthropic)
- `--docs-dir`: Documentation directory
- `--output-dir`: Output directory
- `--requirements`: Requirements file path
- `--start-phase`: Phase to start with (0-based)
- `--end-phase`: Phase to end with (0-based)
- `--interactive`: Run in interactive mode (default)
- `--headless`: Run in headless mode

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of RequirementsManager for post-phase updates
2. Create the FeatureSetManager specification and implementation for complex applications
3. Design and implement the TraceabilityMatrix for artifact relationships
4. Build the EnhancedIntegratedPipeline with all components
5. Implement real tool integrations (Git, linting, testing)

## Execution Commands

1. **Run example:**
   ```bash
   python examples/hello_world.py
   ```

2. **Run basic TDD pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python tdd_pipeline/phased_tdd_implementation.py
   ```

3. **Run markdown-enhanced pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python tdd_pipeline/phased_tdd_implementation_md.py --api-key=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Run integrated pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python tdd_pipeline/integrated_development_pipeline.py --api-key=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## Engineer Task Assignment Template
