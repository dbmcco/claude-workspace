# Spending Pattern Analysis Feature

## Feature Overview
This file provides guidance to Claude when working with the Spending Pattern Analysis feature. This feature analyzes spending patterns from Tiller transaction data to identify trends, anomalies, and provide actionable insights.

## Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Follow strict TDD approach: tests first, then implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. Write failing tests (RED)
  2. Implement minimal code to pass tests (GREEN)
  3. Refactor for quality and maintainability (REFACTOR)
- Test coverage target: 90%

### Code Quality Standards
- Type annotations for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Modular design with single responsibility
- Error handling and validation
- Performance considerations for large datasets

### Dependencies
- lib/data_access: Use for all data access operations
- lib/analysis_engines: Use for analytical functions
- lib/report_generation: Use for report creation
- Multi-Entity Tracking: For entity-specific analysis

## Implementation Context

### Current Implementation
The current implementation in `enhancements/spending_pattern_analyzer.py` includes:
- Basic monthly trend analysis
- Category spending distribution
- Day-of-week pattern analysis
- Simple anomaly detection
- Machine learning clustering
- Basic insight generation
- Static visualizations

### Migration Path
1. Extract core functionality into modular components
2. Create test suite for each component
3. Enhance anomaly detection capabilities
4. Improve machine learning clustering and prediction
5. Expand insight generation
6. Implement interactive visualizations

## Role-Specific Instructions

### For Test Developer
- Create comprehensive test cases with mock transaction data
- Test various pattern detection scenarios
- Create edge case tests for anomaly detection
- Test machine learning components with known patterns
- Test insight generation quality
- Ensure visualization tests

### For Developer
- Implement code to meet test requirements
- Use statistical techniques for pattern recognition
- Implement efficient machine learning algorithms
- Ensure visualization components are configurable
- Optimize for performance with large datasets

### For Architect
- Design clean interfaces between components
- Ensure proper integration with Data Access Layer
- Plan for extensible pattern recognition framework
- Design modular visualization architecture

### For QA
- Verify pattern detection accuracy
- Test anomaly detection with various scenarios
- Validate machine learning results
- Verify insight quality and relevance
- Test visualization quality and interactivity
- Test performance with large datasets

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure
- `temporal_analyzer.py`: Time-based pattern analysis
- `category_analyzer.py`: Category-based analysis
- `anomaly_detector.py`: Anomaly detection
- `ml_analyzer.py`: Machine learning analysis
- `insight_generator.py`: Insight generation
- `visualization_engine.py`: Visualization components

### Key Functions Required
- `analyze_monthly_trends(transactions) -> trends`
- `analyze_category_patterns(transactions) -> patterns`
- `analyze_day_of_week_patterns(transactions) -> patterns`
- `detect_anomalies(transactions, patterns) -> anomalies`
- `cluster_spending_behavior(transactions) -> clusters`
- `generate_insights(patterns, anomalies) -> insights`
- `create_visualizations(patterns, anomalies) -> visualizations`

### Data Structures
- Transaction: Dict with date, description, amount, category
- Pattern: Dict with pattern type, values, confidence
- Anomaly: Dict with transaction, score, reason
- Cluster: Dict with categories, characteristics, metrics
- Insight: Dict with type, message, impact, recommendation
- Visualization: Dict with type, data, options
