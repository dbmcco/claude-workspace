## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The Multi-Claude Development Process solves fundamental problems that emerge when using AI for complex document development:

**Why Context Windows Matter**: Single Claude sessions hit token limits around 100K tokens, but comprehensive PRDs, architecture docs, and requirements often need 200K+ tokens when done properly. Rather than compromising quality, we parallelize development across multiple focused Claude instances.

**Why Standards Compliance Fails**: Without systematic enforcement, AI-generated documents drift from standards, creating inconsistent quality and missing critical elements. Each Claude instance must load and internalize standards before starting work.

**Why Fresh Perspective Reviews Work**: The "curse of knowledge" affects AI just like humans - Claude instances that develop content become attached to their approach. Fresh Claude instances with no development context provide ruthless, unbiased improvement suggestions that dramatically enhance quality.

### 1.2 Core Principles

- **Standards-First**: Every phase begins with loading relevant standards
- **Parallel Processing**: Break large tasks into context-safe chunks for parallel execution
- **Challenge Reviews**: Fresh Claude instances provide unbiased quality improvement
- **Systematic Quality**: Multiple passes ensure standards compliance and polish

### 1.3 Supported Phases

- **PRD Development**: Product Requirements Documents
- **Architecture Design**: System architecture and technical specifications
- **Requirements Analysis**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- **Code Review**: Multi-perspective code analysis and improvement

## 2. Process Architecture

### 2.1 Four-Phase Pipeline

```
Input → Standards Review → Section Parallelization → Challenge Review → Standards Cleanup → Output
  ↓           ↓                     ↓                      ↓               ↓            ↓
Raw Req   Standards-Claude    Multiple Claudes      Challenge-Claude   Polish-Claude   Final Doc
```

**Why This Sequence Works**:

1. **Standards Review First**: Establishes quality framework and section boundaries before any development begins. Prevents rework and ensures consistency.

2. **Parallel Section Development**: Maximizes efficiency while maintaining quality. Each Claude focuses on one domain with full context, preventing the quality degradation that comes from trying to handle everything at once.

3. **Challenge Review with Information Isolation**: This is the secret sauce. Challenge Claude gets NO access to original requirements - only the developed content and standards. This forces fresh evaluation without development bias, consistently identifying gaps and improvements that the original developer missed.

4. **Polish for Standards Compliance**: Final integration ensures nothing falls through cracks. Polish Claude sees everything and verifies complete adherence to standards while maintaining quality improvements from challenge phase.

### 2.2 Claude Instance Roles

#### Standards-Claude
- **Purpose**: Load and apply relevant standards to phase
- **Input**: Raw requirements + standards documents
- **Output**: Standards-compliant initial structure + section breakdown

#### Section-Claudes (Parallel)
- **Purpose**: Develop individual sections with standards context
- **Input**: Standards + section scope + overall context
- **Output**: Detailed section content adhering to standards

#### Challenge-Claude
- **Purpose**: Fresh perspective review and improvement
- **Input**: Section content + standards (NO original requirements)
- **Output**: Improved content with identified gaps and enhancements

#### Polish-Claude
- **Purpose**: Final standards compliance and formatting
- **Input**: Challenge-reviewed content + standards
- **Output**: Final polished document meeting all standards

### 2.3 Context Flow Management

```
Standards Documents → All Claude Instances
Original Requirements → Standards-Claude + Section-Claudes Only
Section Scope → Specific Section-Claude Only
Challenge Input → Challenge-Claude (NO original context)
```

**Why Information Isolation Is Critical**:

**Challenge Claude Isolation**: This is counterintuitive but essential. By denying Challenge Claude access to original requirements, we force it to evaluate content purely on its own merit against standards. This consistently reveals:
- Unclear explanations that made sense to the developer but confuse fresh readers
- Missing context that the developer assumed but didn't document
- Logical gaps that weren't obvious during development
- Opportunities for improvement that bias blinds us to

**Section Claude Focus**: Each section Claude gets full business context but only their specific domain. This prevents context pollution while ensuring domain expertise and consistency with overall objectives.

## 4. Standards Integration

### 4.1 Memory System Structure

```
/.claude/memories/
  standards/
    - prd-standards.md          # PRD structure, content, quality requirements
    - architecture-standards.md # Architecture documentation standards
    - ux-standards.md          # User experience and design standards
  workflows/
    - multi-claude-prd.md      # PRD development process steps
    - multi-claude-architecture.md # Architecture design process steps
    - multi-claude-requirements.md # Requirements analysis process steps
```

### 4.2 Standards Reference Pattern

Each CLAUDE.md includes relevant standards:
```markdown
@../.claude/memories/standards/prd-standards.md
@../.claude/memories/workflows/multi-claude-prd.md
```

### 4.3 Standards Loading Strategy

- **Standards-Claude**: Loads ALL relevant standards for comprehensive review
- **Section-Claudes**: Load standards + specific section requirements
- **Challenge-Claude**: Standards only (no original context)
- **Polish-Claude**: Standards + formatting requirements

---

## 5. Context Management

### 5.1 Context Window Optimization

#### Section Size Guidelines
- **Maximum**: 8,000 tokens per section (safe context limit)
- **Optimal**: 5,000-6,000 tokens per section
- **Minimum**: 2,000 tokens per section (efficient parallelization)

#### Section Boundary Principles
- **Logical Cohesion**: Sections should be self-contained logical units
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce cross-section dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define how sections connect and reference each other
- **Balanced Size**: Aim for roughly equal section sizes

### 5.2 Information Isolation

#### What Each Claude Instance Knows
```
Standards-Claude:
✓ Raw requirements
✓ All standards
✓ Process workflows
✗ Section-specific details

Section-Claudes:
✓ Overall context and scope

Challenge-Claude:
✓ Section content to review
✓ Relevant standards
✗ Original requirements
✗ Section development context

Polish-Claude:
✓ All reviewed content
✓ All standards
✓ Formatting requirements
✗ Original development context
```

### 5.3 Context Handoff Protocols

#### Standards-Claude → Section-Claudes
- Standards documents (full)
- Section definitions and scope
- Overall project context
- Interface requirements
- Cross-reference guidelines

#### Section-Claudes → Challenge-Claude
- Complete section content
- Relevant standards only
- NO original requirements or development context
