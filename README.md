# Claude Workspace

A repository for managing and optimizing Claude Code configurations across multiple projects.

## Vision

Create a centralized, version-controlled system for Claude Code memory files and settings that:
- Follows LLM-driven development principles
- Uses granular, reusable memory modules
- Maintains project-specific customizations
- Enables systematic optimization across all projects

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Development** - This is an experimental repository for testing and iterating on Claude Code configuration patterns.

## Safety First

All existing CLAUDE.md files and settings are preserved in the `backup/` directory before any changes are applied.

## Structure

```
claude-workspace/
â”œâ”€â”€ backup/              # Preserved existing configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ memories/            # Reusable memory modules
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/            # Settings templates by project type
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/              # Automation and migration tools
â””â”€â”€ docs/               # Documentation and guides
```

## Quick Start

**DO NOT APPLY TO PRODUCTION PROJECTS YET**

This repository is for experimentation and validation only.

## Contributing

Since this affects Bray.Doc's entire development workflow, all changes should be:
1. Tested in isolated projects first
2. Validated for effectiveness
3. Documented with rationale
4. Applied incrementally
