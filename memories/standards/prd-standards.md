## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) serve as the definitive specification for product development, ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what will be built, why it matters, and how success will be measured.

### 1.2 Scope

These standards apply to all PRDs across:

- Feature enhancements
- System integrations
- Technical product specifications
- Internal tools and utilities

### 1.3 Design Principles

- **Clarity**: Every requirement must be unambiguous and testable
- **Completeness**: All necessary information for development and testing
- **Traceability**: Clear links between business goals and technical requirements
- **Measurability**: Success criteria must be quantifiable
- **Feasibility**: Requirements must be technically and economically viable

### 1.4 Document Quality Goals

- **Stakeholder Alignment**: 100% stakeholder sign-off before development
- **Requirement Clarity**: Zero ambiguous requirements in final document
- **Testability**: 100% of requirements must be verifiable
- **Change Management**: Clear process for requirement modifications
