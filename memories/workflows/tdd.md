# Test-Driven Development Workflow

## Testing Philosophy
- TDD is mandatory - write tests first
- Comprehensive test coverage is required
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Each test should test one thing
- Tests should be independent and repeatable

## TodoWrite Usage
- **ALWAYS** use TodoWrite tool to track tasks throughout development
- Update task status in real-time: pending → in_progress → completed
- Only ONE task should be in_progress at a time
- Create detailed subtasks for complex features
